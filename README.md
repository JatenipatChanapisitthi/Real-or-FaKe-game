## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

The game is designed for in-person play, where one player is secretly selected as the "fake" and must try to blend in while others try to expose them. Unlike *The Chameleon*, this version introduces custom categories and simplified rules for quick setup and play. **(now available in thai language)**
